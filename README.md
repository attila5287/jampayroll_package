jam in package : just a minute payroll python flask web app full stack app
justaminutepayroll.herokuapp.com

What is this app for?
- The app generates quick paystubs, calculates total hours on timesheet for busy managers on the go
with no records. This is the CRUD mode where the user creates paystubs as a printable document (ctrl-p)
while on browser and deletes all input after logout

- Those who would like to create an account also enjoy database support that brings secure login options, 
recording employee data such as their names, allowance, hourly rates etc. to postgreSQL server where it 
could be extracted later and transformed into usable data groups (aka payroll reports/audit reports)
grouped under employee, company, time periods, departments etc. This is a nice function that could generate
payroll reports for audits or internal purposes etc. 

What is all this is about?
- Developer's objective was to build an ETL (extract transform load) app totally open source with presentalbe
modern style documents; to make it free and open to use by anyone who woul
